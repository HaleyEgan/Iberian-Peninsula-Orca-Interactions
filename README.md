# Iberian Peninsula Orca Interactions, 2022-2024
## Overview
This project began out of personal interest and passion. Living in the Puget Sound, we often have Transient and Resident Orcas nearby, and it's not uncommon to see them from shore using updates from Orca Network for tracking. During the summer of 2025, I was lucky enough to walk the Camino Portugese Litoral, walking 200 miles from Porto, Portugal to Santiago de Compostela, Spain along the coast. Learning about the Iberian coast and their local orca population inspired me to dig into the orca and vessel interactions that have been occurring in that area over the past few years. Even while I was on the Camino, two orca-vessel interactions occurred near Lisbon, resulting in the capsizing of one vessel (no one was hurt). 

## Data
This project explores a public dataset provided by the [Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS)](https://obis.org/dataset/178820dc-ead7-497b-b2a2-2c8ea4d5a084), which documented 107 orca interactions entered into the AnvaNet system, from 2022-2024.
